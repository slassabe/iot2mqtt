## Description

**iot2mqtt** offers a robust and flexible solution for integrating various IoT devices using the MQTT protocol. Whether you are looking to connect directly with devices or through gateways, **iot2mqtt** provides the tools you need to build reliable and scalable IoT applications.

### Key Features

- **Programmatic Alternative**: Provides more flexibility and control compared to traditional home automation platforms like openHAB, Home Assistant, and Jeedom.
- **Reliable Communication**: Leverages the MQTT protocol to ensure reliable data transfer between devices.
- **Protocol-Agnostic**: Supports both direct device integration over MQTT (e.g., Shelly, Tasmota) and gateway integration (e.g., Zigbee2MQTT, ring to MQTT, miflora to MQTT).
- **Abstract Devices**: Comprehensive support for creating and managing abstract devices, simplifying the integration between different device models, providers, and protocols.
