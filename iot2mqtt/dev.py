This module defines various enumerations and classes related to IoT device models, protocols, 
and actions. It also includes custom exceptions for handling specific error cases.

Classes and Enums
-----------------

- Model: Represents a model of an IoT device.
- ModelFactory: Singleton class responsible for managing instances of Model objects.
- Protocol: Enumeration representing different communication protocols used by IoT devices.
- Device: Represents a generic IoT device in the system.
- ButtonAction: Enumeration defining button action values.
